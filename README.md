## Code Explanation:-
The code implements a timed quiz application in Java. It defines a `Question` class to store a question, multiple options, and the correct answer. The `Quiz` class manages the quiz, with methods to display questions, get user answers, and check correctness. Each question has a 15-second timer, after which the answer is marked incorrect if not provided in time. The quiz displays feedback on correctness, updates the score, and shows the final result at the end. The main class `QuizApplication` initializes a set of questions and starts the quiz, allowing users to answer and track their performance.
